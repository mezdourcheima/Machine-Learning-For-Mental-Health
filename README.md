# Machine-Learning-For-Mental-Health
The project involves machine learning models that can assist in predicting mental health conditions, analyzing mental health-related data and creating tools that help in diagnosing or monitoring mental health conditions.

The data used in this project is <b> Mental Health in Tech Survey </b> from Kaggle datasets.

This project is devdided to some parts : 
  - Data preprocessing
  - Exploratoty Data Analysis
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Selection 
    - For model selsction, we tried to performe several models and see how each model will behave. The models are : 

      1 - Logistic Regression is a statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. It is a popular algorithm for binary classification problems. 

      2 - Decision Trees: Decision trees are tree-like models that use a series of decisions to classify data. Decision trees can handle both categorical and continuous data. 

      3 - Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and stability of the model. It is one of the most popular algorithms for binary classification problems.

      4 - Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm that calculates the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class based on the conditional probabilities of each feature. 

      5 - Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is a linear classification algorithm that finds the best hyperplane to separate data points into different classes.

      6 - Gradient Boosted Trees: Gradient Boosted Trees are another ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve model accuracy. Gradient Boosted Trees are especially useful for handling imbalanced datasets. 

      7 - Neural Networks: Neural networks are a set of algorithms that can learn and recognize patterns in data. They are used for both binary and multi-class classification problems.
